# InPvP-Language
Language files for InPvP Plugins.

Each Plugin's language file is located in the Folder of that plugin.

Some files may be outdated, so if you see a language you know, check over it!

# Don't know how to use GitHub?
- Save the en_gb.yml file to your computer.
- Edit the file in an editor of your choice, please make sure you follow the YAML format correctly, and that you keep the {variables} in place.

- If you're not sure on a translation, remove the line from the file.

Then send this to dan@inpvp.net

# If you know how to use GitHub
- Fork this repository
- Copy the en_gb.yml files to a suitable filename
- Commit changes
- Submit a pull-request

# Language File Syntax
Variables are defined as {key}, you can also pull other language translations by using {L_key}, e.g. {L_PREFIX}

Colours are used by &{colourCode} e.g. &7This is gray &eAnd this is yellow!

Please keep all keys exactly how they are, otherwise they won't work. This includes all caps.
